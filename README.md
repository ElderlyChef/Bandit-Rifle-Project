These files are meant to remain private and only for the use of creating a single bandit prop for a 
selected winner of a local LAN between only 12-16 people at a given time. This is meant as a giveaway and videos uploaded are only meant to help the 
"winner" with their filament color selection of pieces. This link is meant only for those purposes and 
should only be shared to correct individuals. There is no access directly the files of each piece which I have purchased for personal use.

How to Proceed for selecting colors:

The winner can choose up to 3 filament colors. The barrel portion of the print will be a default of either a copper-like PLA, silver-like PLA, or copper-like PLA.
This will not be considered one of the 3 color choices. You can give a generic color and I will pick out the filament or you can select your own filament choices.
I will give a couple default references from Amazon to help. The biggest thing to make sure of is that the filament you are selecting is of type PLA. 3D printers can
print a number of different types of filament, so it is important to make sure to select the correct type I am looking to print with for this giveaway. 

Next you will need to select which pieces will get what color. To help with this I have taken screenshots of the three different subassemblies of the project and labeled 
most of the pieces seen in each video. With this you should be able to label each number with a color within each assembly. Here is a blank template for each screenshot to be labeled.
